- One of the most common auto accidents in the U.S. are side-impact, merging and rear-end collisions. If our idea of an LED display wanring other drivers can save even one life, it is worth it. 
- Our customers will be manufacturers, rental companies, and vehicle owenrs who are concerned about the risk of getting rear ended due to being followed too closely or by someone serving in their lane. 
- The design must be able to detect when another vehicle is in close proximity to the vehicle the system is placed on. Additionally this system must be able to raise a flag when another vehicle is too close. 
- In most vehicles manufactured after 2016, proximity sensors are standard. Also vehicles are required to have working turn signals and brake lightsOur project will add to both of these technologies to notify drivers of vehicles without proximity sensors when they are close to a vehicle with proximity sensors.
- Blind Spot Monitoring System was designed to let the driver know when there is a vehicle in the blind spot of one of the side mirrors. This could be used to perform a similar function where instead of alerting the driver it could alert the other vehicle that is in the blind spot.
- The product will be attached to the rear bumper and used whenever the vehicle is activated. Whether backing out of a parking lot or driving along the highway, collisions can be found anywhere at any time. The system should work during the day or night, rain or shine.
- In order to address the problem, it is important to understand that many auto accidents are caused by lack of alert systems at the moment and having a visually intuitive alert system can be helpful.

## Business Model Canvas

[Business Model Canvas](https://github.com/jvarnon1/Second-Person-Proximity-Sensor/files/6174683/7.5_.Assignment.7.-.Research.Assignment.Group.-.Sheet1.4.pdf)

Business Mode Canvas is used as a strategic management approach for developing new or existing business. A draft BMC was applied to our project and the followings were illustrated:

- Key Partners
- Key Activities
- Key Resources
- Value Proposition
- Customer Relationships
- Channels
- Cost Structure
- Revenue Streams

## Data Analytics Utilization

[Data Analytics Utilization](https://github.com/jvarnon1/Second-Person-Proximity-Sensor/files/6174691/9.5_.Assignment.9.-.Research.Assignment.Team.2.pdf)

The 'Reporting, Predictive Analytics, & Everything in Between' guide was utilized to help us briefly analyze how we might use data analytics in our project.

- Chapter 1
  - Introduces the three analytical components: data exploration and visual analytics, data science and machine learning, and reporting.
  - Explains why data is so crucial along with the different steps with how to discover, predict, and report on it.
  - For our project, finding data from national statistics about vehicle incidents to sensor data from our product will create predictions on how successful it is in saving lives and money in the long run.
 
- Chapter 2
  - Explains those components in detail and helps us address business problems we might encounter using the provided knowledge.
  - Once we gather data concerning any aspect of our business plan, we need to analyze it to draw insights that can help us solve business problems and make business decisions.

- Chapter 3
  - Recommends using embedded reporting which is a platform that allows the stakeholders or the customers to consume data easily from the product. We can utilize this type of report by making the LED have trackable devices that can have itâ€™s indicator at the dashboard, like when your engine light goes on.
  - Mentions analyzing data in real time using streaming analytics. It could be very useful if we use it to track cars who have been in a car crash and also those who just avoided a crash.

## Engineering/Computer standards application

[Engineering/Computer standards application](https://github.com/jvarnon1/Second-Person-Proximity-Sensor/files/6174742/401.11.5.Research.Assignment.1.pdf)

Using some sources('An Introduction to Computer Security' by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, 'The Government-Industry Data Exchange Program: Operations Manual' by the Assistant Secretary of Navy [Research, Development and Acquisition] Product Integrity), engineering and computer standards that might apply to our project were introduced.
